VIPN project is trying to create VIP based private, personal network, with untraceable and unlimited access.
Right now, people usually use VPN [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network] for most of the similiar cases.

Many people tried to create their own VPN, such as [https://moshuqi.github.io/2017/07/20/%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E6%90%AD%E5%BB%BAVPN%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1%E5%99%A8/]
So if we can use EC2, it might be possible.
